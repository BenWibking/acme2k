acme2k is configured through modifying the config.h -header
file, not unlike some other group's modus operandi. This might
take some time getting used to but you'll soon be appreciating
the zen of not adding any unneccesary baggage to all these ported
plan9-libraries acme is - oh - so dependent on.

Here's a quick recap what all the variables do and do not do:

---- BOOLEANS: 0 or FALSE for false and 1 or TRUE for true

globalautoindent tries to guess where to add autoindentation by the
context of the previous line. Standard stuff. Comes highly suggested.

swapscrollbuttons swaps the mouse buttons you use to scroll, causing
B1 scroll down now, instead of up and vice versa for B2.

bartflag triggers quote unquote experimental mode, in which the window
focus doesn't follow just with the hover of a mouse, but the buffer
clicked on or last typed on. A hidden gem. Comes highly suggested.

---- ARRAYS: two strings inside curly brackets,
----               separated by a single comma.

fontnames[2] takes two fonts as input: first one, [0], it treats as a
proportional-width font and uses as the main UI typeface, while the
second [1] acts the role of a fixed-width. This font comes into play on
per-window basis when `Font` has been executed on the very buffer it
applies itself to, or on the tag window. These are however nothing more
than stylistic guidelines and the fontnames-array can be treated as what
it is. Two fonts just hanging around.

Note: `Font` can also be executed with any valid font from `fontsrv -p .`
or `/lib/font/bit` ($PLAN9/font) as an argument, thus allowing you to
experiment with typeface sizes as long as you please.
