acme2k is configured through modifying the config.h -header
file, not unlike some other group's modus operandi. This might
take some time getting used to but you'll soon be appreciating
the zen of not adding any unneccesary baggage to all these ported
plan9-libraries acme is - oh - so dependent on.

Before compiling mv/copy config.def.h as config.h and here's a quick
recap what all the variables do and do not do:


---- BOOLEANS:     [ 0 || FALSE ] => false 
----           ||  [ 1 ||  TRUE ] => true

`globalautoindent` tries to guess where to add indentation by the
context of the previous line. Standard stuff. Comes highly suggested.

`swapscrollbuttons` swaps the mouse buttons you use to scroll,
causing B1 scroll down now, instead of up and vice versa for B2.

`bartflag` triggers quote unquote experimental mode, in which the 
window focus doesn't follow just with the hover of a mouse, but the
buffer clicked on or last typed on. A hidden gem. Comes highly suggested.


---- ARRAYS: two strings inside curly brackets,
----               separated by a single comma.

fontnames[2] takes two fonts as input: first one, [0], it treats as a
proportional-width font and uses as the main UI typeface, while the
second [1] acts the role of a fixed-width. This font comes into play on
per-window basis when `Font` has been executed on the tag window or on 
the very buffer it applies itself to. These are however nothing more
than stylistic guidelines and the fontnames-array can be treated as what
it is. A font and a font to toggle to.

Note: `Font` can also be executed with any valid font from `fontsrv -p .`
or `/lib/font/bit` ($PLAN9/font) as an argument, thus allowing you to
experiment with typeface sizes as long as you please.
