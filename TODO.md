### todo
+ .diff -file for easier application (modified files so far: acme.c, mkfile, config.h)
+ fontsrv-modification (LCDFILTER? hardcoded dpi? font-height? see: `$PLAN9/src/cmd/fontsrv/x11.c`)
+ cursor color and shape (it defaults still to black in center even though the blocks seem to follow the text foreground color rule)
+ ctrl+shift+r = redo; delete = deletes current character see: `$PLAN9/include/keyboard.h` and `$PLAN9/src/cmd/acme/text.c`.
+ look into grabbing just the neccesary parts of acme from plan9port to create a "stand alone complex" of some sort
+ add more to do (contribute by adding an issue)
